# MetaKeep Lambda - Import UniswapV2Router and Swap Matic tokens for USDC

This repository contains the code that demonstrates how you can import any popular smart contract like Uniswap in Metakeep,
and Invoke any of its method.

This project is intended to be used with the
[MetaKeep Lambda Import and Invocation Tutorial Series](https://docs.metakeep.xyz/docs/create-your-first-lambda), but you should be
able to follow it by yourself by reading the README and exploring its `scripts` directories.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- [scripts](./scripts): Contains the scripts to import already deployed smart contract and invoke its functions.

## Quick start

The first thing you need to do is clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PassbirdCo/MetaKeepCodeSamples.git
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's `lambda/lambda-import/scripts` folder and run the scripts:

```sh
npm run importContract
