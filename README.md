Hi Tom,

As discussed, the attached is the order form for your review. Would really appreciate if we can wrap this up by tomorrow. Also, please let me know if you have any questions. But, I think you should be able to fill it out without any issues.

Also, the API key and secret key are in the email I sent you earlier.

hello, I am a full stack developer. I have rich experience in web development. I have read your requirements carefully. I can complete your project perfectly. I am ready to start your project immediately. I am More

To debug 500 errors, tap on the link in the email you received. You will see 500 errors for
all APIs together. To get 500 errors per API, go to the Dashboard and check the 500 errors graph. Now that you know which API is failing and the time of failure, you can check the logs for that API.

For more detailed metrics, checkout all metrics for the API gateway.

Hey Ashay.
Thanks a lot for finishing the assignment. Your design was very impressive.
Due to tight schedule, we have decided to go with another designer.
We will keep you in mind for future projects. Thanks again for your time and effort.

Hey Neekunj,

Thanks a lot of for preparing the Notion document. It was very detailed and informative. Naga and I synced and we decided to not move forward at this point. We are early stage and need someone with more experience on the blockchain side.

I will reach out to you again in future as we grow more. Your experience and knowledge will be very valuable for us in a later stage. Thanks again for your time and effort.

The response will return **max 100** tokens at a time.
If the user has more than 100 tokens, the developer will have to make multiple requests to get all the tokens. The response will have a `pagination token` which can be used to get the next set of tokens. Once the response does not have a `pagination token`, it means that all the tokens have been returned.

Trying to get all tokens for a user can be slow and lead to a poor user experience. We recommend that you only get the tokens for the collections you need. For example, if you only need the tokens for the `CryptoPunks` collection, you can use the `collections` parameter to get only the tokens for that collection.

Since the response only returns 100 tokens at a time, you can use the `paginationToken` to get the next set of tokens. If this is not set, the response will return the first 100 tokens.

Hey William.

The latest ListTokens API is now available for production use.
The API allows you to get all the tokens for a user in a single request. You can also filter the tokens for a list of collections. For the best performance, we recommend that you only get the tokens for the collections you need. Please take a look at the API documentation for more details.

Also, the request format has changed slightly. If you are old request format, please update your request to the new format.

To give a little more context, our wallet creation process is extremely simple with no friction for end-users. Developers make an API call to the getWallet(https://docs.metakeep.xyz/reference/v3-getwallet-api) and we do all the magic in the background to create a wallet for the user.

# Transaction Events

If the transaction has emitted events, they will be returned in the `events` field. Here's how the response will look like

# Transaction Failure

If a transaction is marked `FAILED`, it would me an that MetaKeep has exhausted all feasible smart AI-based strategies to recover from failure, that would have been attempted by humans and so the "FAILED" status, if shown, is final.

The reason for failure, if available, will be returned in the `failureReason` field.Here's how the response will look like if the transaction has failed

Do you need them for few hours or on a daily basis? We can do both. Please let us know your requirements and we can discuss the pricing.

Got it. We are currently building the NFT marketplace keeping in mind the best user and developer experience just like other MetaKeep products. It's a great time to get your design inputs.

Let's talk more in Monday's call to understand more about your requirements.

First, select the chain on which you want to use your app:

- **Polygon**: Polygon supports cheap and fast transactions. It is a great choice for apps that need to support a large number of users.
- **Binance**: Binance has higher transaction fees and throughput.

Then choose the environment:

- **Production**: Select this option for production apps.
- **Development**: Select this option for development and testing apps.

<span>Select the chain, on which you want to use your app.</span>

<ul>
<li>
    <b>Polygon Mainnet</b>: Select this for production ready apps
</li>
<li>
    <b>Polygon Mumbai</b>: Select this for development and testing
    apps
</li>
</ul>

This API allows you get user's balance for any currency. The API will return the balance for the user in the `balance` field. In case the currency is created using MetaKeep, the API will also return the locked balance for the user in the `locked` field. Note that `balance` = `locked` balance + `unlocked` balance.

Hey. I had filed a maintenance request yesterday for 366 Apt 16. The maintenance team has not responded yet. Can you please check with them?

There is no reason to use Alchmey. MetaKeep takes care of formatting and normalizing the data for you.

How do I send a transaction to the Polygon Mumbai testnet?
How about the Solana testnet and the Binance testnet and mainnet?

Once upon a time, there was a small town called MetaKeep Town. The town was very small and there was only one bank in the town. The bank was called MetaKeep Bank. The bank was very old and had a very old and outdated system. The bank was not able to keep up with the changing times and was unable to meet the needs of the people. Then,

Question: What is the difference between the `balance` and `locked` fields?
Answer: The `balance` field will return the total balance for the user. The `locked` field will return the locked balance for the user. The `locked` balance is the balance that is locked in a transaction. The `unlocked` balance is the balance that is not locked in a transaction.

Question: What is the difference between ECDSA and EdDSA?
Answer: ECDSA is a signature scheme that uses elliptic curve cryptography. EdDSA is a signature scheme that uses Edwards-curve cryptography. Both are secure and are used for signing transactions. MetaKeep uses EdDSA for signing transactions.

Question: What is the difference between a smart contract and a wallet?
Answer: A smart contract is a program that runs on a blockchain. A wallet is a program that runs on a computer. A smart contract can be used to create a wallet. A wallet can be used to create a smart contract.

Question: What is MetaKeep?
Answer: MetaKeep is a blockchain platform that makes it easy to build and deploy blockchain applications. MetaKeep is a platform that makes it easy to build and deploy blockchain applications. MetaKeep is a platform that makes it easy to build and deploy blockchain applications.

Question: Which is the public key for private key `0x1234`?
Answer: The public key for private key `0x1234` is `0x5678`.

Question: What is the difference between solana and MetaKeep?
Answer: Solana is a blockchain platform that makes it easy to build and deploy blockchain applications. MetaKeep is a blockchain platform that makes it easy to build and deploy blockchain applications. MetaKeep is a blockchain platform that makes it easy to build and deploy blockchain applications.

Full API Keys are never stored, only the first four characters will be shown. You can only view the full API Key at the time of creation.

Hey @ChristopherKramer @marphil_llc. From the discussion looks like Hive lite accounts are just database entries and they are not on the chain. What kind of MetaKeep integration do you want for the Hive lite accounts?

## Chain Identifier

This API expects the chain identifier to be passed in the `chain` field. The chain identifier can be one of the following:

- **80001**: Polygon Mumbai
- **137**: Polygon Mainnet
- **97**: Binance Testnet
- **56**: Binance Mainnet

Note that symbol(e.g. USDC) transfer is not supported on all chains. Please check the [MetaKeep docs](https://docs.metakeep.com/docs/chain-ids) for more details.

## Chain Compatibility

MetaKeep has full support for Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. MetaKeep has partial support all EVM chains.

The tables below show the compatibility of MetaKeep API/SDKs with different chains.

# Get wallet

`getWallet` function in the SDK returns the `public wallet` of the user. This function returns the exact same response as the `/v3/getWallet` API endpoint.
The user goes through a verification process before the wallet is returned.

For lower user friction, we recommend using the `/v3/getWallet` API endpoint instead of the SDK. `/v3/getWallet` API endpoint doesn't require user verification.

Note that the `getWallet` function and `/v3`

# Calling `getWallet`

`getWallet` return a promise that resolves when the user verification is complete. The response looks like this:

    {

Hey @babygirlme , how's the integration going?
We have launched new wallet UI and SDKs. Let me know if you need any help.

Hey Emanuel. Checking in to see if you got my

Specifically, this is what you need

1. When users buy a ticker, get the user's ethAddress from the getWallet API and mint an NFT to user's address.
   This API requires no user verification and the wallet is created on the fly if it doesn't exist.

2. For message and transaction signing, use the MetaKeep client SDK. You will use sdk.signMessage and sdk.signTransaction depending on the use case.

Let us know if you have any questions. We are always here to help.

Hey Ayushi. As discussed in the meeting, for the evaulation you guys will test the website and 2 APIs.

Here are the links:

1. https://console.metakeep.com/. This is the the website for testing. You will also use this to create your api keys for API testing.
2. User wallet API: https://docs.metakeep.xyz/reference/v3-getwallet-api
3. Developer wallet API: https://docs.metakeep.xyz/reference/v3getdeveloperwallet-1

You can choose Polygon chain. The wallet will work for all EVM chains.

Is MetaKeep provider compatible with web3.js?
Yes, it is. You can use the provider to sign transactions and messages. You can also use the provider to interact with smart contracts.

Do we have to initialize the SDK on page load or it can be instantiated anytime?
It can be instantiated anytime. You can use the SDK to sign messages and transactions.

Hey Kai.
Sorry for the late reply.
Just got time to go through the docs. Thanks for sending them over. This answers a lot of our questions.

Now generate base64 32 bytes salt using OpenSSL
openssl rand -base64 32

Thanks, Arpit. Can you explain why website testing wil take only 2 days?
I am having trouble understanding the discrepancy between the time you are estimating for website testing and the time you are estimating for API testing.

This API is throttled.
Note that this is a public endpoint and subject to throttling. This API is used by public NFT marketplaces to index MetaKeep NFTs.

We recommend using List TOkens API instead that will return all the tokens along with their metadata.

Notice the case of the key names in the response.
JSON response above uses snake_case for key names to be compatible with public NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. This is different from all other MetaKeep APIs that use snake_case for key names.

# MetaKeep user wallets

MetaKeep user wallets are non-custodial wallets that exclusively owned by the end-users. Developers can interact with user wallets using MetaKeep APIs and Client SDKs.

# Customizing the Wallet UI

To customize the wallet UI, you first need to create an app in the MetaKeep console. Once you have created an app, you can customize the wallet UI by editing the app's settings.

Each app has unique user wallet settings. This means that each app can have a different app name, logo and color scheme. Underneath, the user wallet address is the same for all apps.

Note that the user wallet address is the same for all apps. This means that if a user has a wallet for app A, the same wallet will be used for app B. App A and app B will have different app names, logos and color schemes. This allows developers to create multiple apps with different branding.

## Customize the name

To customize the app name, go to the app settings and change the app name. The app name will be displayed in the wallet UI.

Note that if the wallet name is empty, the app name will be used as the wallet name.

Check the UI tooltips. MetaKeep console is full of tooltips that explain what each setting does.

There are 3 ways to customize the wallet UI:

1. Change the app name
2. Change the app logo
3. Change the app color scheme

## Customize the logo

To customize the app logo, go to the app settings and upload a new logo. The logo will be displayed in the wallet UI.

We recommend using a rectangular image with dimensions 1000px x 180px. This will put your brand at front and center of the wallet UI.

If the logo is empty, a placeholder logo will be used.

Support for uploading a logo is coming soon. For now, you can use the placeholder logo.

## Customize the color scheme

To customize the color scheme, go to the app settings and change the color scheme. The color scheme will be used in the wallet UI.

If the color scheme is empty, black color scheme will be used.

## Viewing the wallet UI

After you have customized the wallet UI, you can view the wallet UI by clicking on the "View Wallet" button in the app settings.

## Customize Verification Email

MetaKeep sends a verification email to the user when the developer is trying to perform an action(e.g. getConsent, signMessage etc) on users wallets that requires user verification.

After you have customized the wallet UI, the verification will automatically be branded with your wallet customization without any additional work.
The email will have the custom wallet name and logo.

User wallets are a critical component of many applications, as they allow users to store and manage their digital assets and assets. As a developer, you may want to customize the user wallet to match the look and feel of your application, or to incorporate your brand in a more prominent way. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the ways in which developers can customize user wallets to better fit their needs and goals.

Customize the Look and Feel: One of the most basic ways to customize a user wallet is by changing its appearance. This can involve anything from changing the color scheme and font choices to adding custom graphics and icons. By tailoring the wallet's visual design to match your application, you can create a more cohesive user experience and strengthen your brand's presence.

Customize the Name and Brand Image: Another way to customize a user wallet is by changing its name and branding. This can involve using a custom logo or icon, or even renaming the wallet itself to something more closely aligned with your brand. This can help to create a more cohesive experience for your users, and can also help to differentiate your wallet from others on the market.

Integrate with Your Application: One of the key benefits of customizing a user wallet is the ability to integrate it seamlessly with your application. This can involve everything from enabling users to access their wallet directly from your application to integrating wallet functionality into your application's user interface. By doing this, you can create a more seamless and convenient experience for your users, and make it easier for them to manage their digital assets.

In summary, customizing a user wallet can be a powerful way to differentiate your application and create a more cohesive user experience. By changing the wallet's appearance, branding, and integrating it with your application, you can create a wallet that truly reflects your brand and meets the needs of your users.

## Connecting to third party dapps

MetaKeep user wallets support connecting to third party dapps through WalletConnect. WalletConnect is a protocol for connecting decentralized applications to mobile wallets with QR code scanning (desktop) or deep linking (mobile). This allows you to use MetaKeep to interact with any dapp that supports WalletConnect.

Coming soon. We are launching this feature in the next few weeks.

#Tracking gas costs
You can track gas costs by finding the gas used for each transaction. Transaction status API returns the transaction hash which you can use to lookup gas details.

This information should ideally in the MetaKeep console. I have taken a note of this and added it to our roadmap.

Would you be able to provide us with a list of automated and manual tests that you will be performing especially for the SDK testing? We are comparing different providers and would like to understand the scope and breadth of testing that you will be performing.

# Do you support external wallets?

Currently, we only support MetaKeep developer wallets. We are working on adding support for external wallets. This will allow you to manage your keys using any third party wallet(e.g. Metamask, Ledger, Trezor etc). External wallets will also support zero-friction and gasless transactions.

However, we recommend using MetaKeep developer wallets for now. MetaKeep developer wallets are non-custodial wallets that are exclusively owned by the you. There is no risk of ever losing your keys or worrying about your wallet being hacked. MetaKeep takes care of all the security and maintenance for you.

Let us know if you need this feature urgently. We can prioritize it.

Note that external wallets are not supported for end-users at the moment. We are working on adding support for external wallets for end-users. This will allow end-users to manage their keys using any third party wallet(e.g. Metamask, Ledger, Trezor etc). External wallets will also support zero-friction and gasless transactions.

Hey Arpit. We discussed this internally and SDK testing is one the top priorities for us. It is a critical part of our product and we want to make sure that it is tested.

Since you haven't been able to give us a timeline on that, for now we are going to move forward with another provider. We will keep you in mind for future projects. Thanks for your time and help.

# Skip final dialog

Wallet shows a success or failure dialog after every interaction with the user wallet.
Turn on the toggle to skip the dialog.

Note that the failure dialog will always be shown.

# Branded verification email

Hey guys.

As requested, branded verification emails are now live(https://docs.metakeep.xyz/docs/customize-verification-email).

If you are looking for more email customization or have any feedback, please let us know.

# Looking for more customization?

If you are looking for more customized email, please let us know.

# Advanced Customization

User wallets offer advanced customization options. Most developers shouldn't need to tinker with these settings. Feel free to reach out to us if you need help with these settings.

To access advanced customization options, open up the `Advanced Settings` in user wallet settings.

Here are the advanced customization options:

## Skip final dialog

Whenever the user wallet is used to perform an action(e.g. getConsent, signMessage etc), the UI shows a success or failure dialog after the action is performed. If you would like to skip the this dialog, turn on the `Skip final dialog` toggle.

Note that if this toggle is turned on, we expect developers to show the appropriate success or failure dialog in their app based on the response from the user wallet. All user wallet options using the MetaKeep Client SDK return a promise that resolves on success and rejects on failure. You can use this promise to show the appropriate dialog in your app.

## Next Steps

In the upcoming articles we will learn more about OpenSea and make NFT trades on OpenSea using MetaKeep wallet. We will also learn how to use MetaKeep to create a decentralized exchange and make trades on the decentralized exchange.

If there are any `Hidden` NFTs, select the NFTs you want to unhide and click on the `Continue` button.

Hey guys.

As requested by you, super excited to announce that branded verification emails are now live 🎉🎉(https://docs.metakeep.xyz/docs/customize-verification-email).
Please let us know if you have any feedback or questions.

Hey guys! Branded verification emails are now live 🎉🎉 and ready for you to use! We've been working hard to bring this new feature to you as fast as possible. Check out https://docs.metakeep.xyz/docs/customize-verification-email to learn more and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.

Listing NFTs require tokens to pay for the gas fee
Make sure to buy some tokens before listing NFTs. Support for buying token directly from the wallet is coming soon.

# WalletConnect Integration customization

MetaKeep wallet protocol supports WalletConnect integration. WalletConnect integration URL is `https://wallet.metakeep.xyz/`. 
 To access WalletConnect integration, navigate to the wallet.metakeep.xyz. Follow the detailed guide here: https://docs.metakeep.xyz/docs/walletconnect-integration to learn more about WalletConnect integration.

By default, wallet connect integration is branded with MetaKeep logo and name. To customize the branding, follow the steps to customize your app and then pass app_id as the query parameter to the wallet connect integration URL. For example, if your app_id is `2452849e-d6e9-40ef-bbfd-5dfdc7ce1728`, the wallet connect integration URL will be `https://wallet.metakeep.xyz/?app_id=2452849e-d6e9-40ef-bbfd-5dfdc7ce1728`. WalletConnect integration page will be branded with your app's logo, name and color scheme.

Check out customtized and branded WalletConnect!
You can find wallet connect with a custom logo, name and color scheme here: https://wallet.metakeep.xyz/?app_id=2452849e-d6e9-40ef-bbfd-5dfdc7ce1728

Make sure `Skip final dilaog` is turned on for the app to work with WalletConnect.

Q1: We  went through the doc and their architecture very different from ours. I am happy answer any specific questions you have about us in an another call.

Q2. So the brands usually have a preferred chain. If not, we help them make a decision based on our partnerships and their requirements. 

Yes, the wallet is interoperable. But usually customers/brands have a preference for a chain.
Also, as discussed in the call, we don't add support for a chain unless we have a customer who wants to use it and willing to pay for the integration work.

I went through the doc and as we explained in the call, their architecture is very different from ours. I am happy answer any specific questions you have about us in an another call.

Give me sometime to go through this doc. From a cursory glance, as discussed in the call, their architecture is very different from ours. 



create a regex that matches localhost and https://consent.metakeep.xyz/consent
regex = /localhost|https:\/\/consent.metakeep.xyz\/consent/


Domains need to be stored per user and need to be an array. Domains should expire in 30 days.

```
[
{
    "user_id": "user_id1",
    "domains": [
        {
            "domain": "https://consent.metakeep.xyz/consent",
            "expires_at_millis": "timestamp"
        }
    ]
},
{
    "user_id": "user_id2",
    "domains": [
        {
            "domain": "https://consent.metakeep.xyz/consent",
            "expires_at_millis": "timestamp"
        }
    ]
}

## Web3 Provider common issues
Web3.js and ethers.js behavior can change over time. MetaKeep web3 provider takes care of most of the edge cases and intricacies of web3.js and ethers.js.
 However, we recommend following the best practices below to have consistent and predictable behavior for you and your users.

### Provide gas
You should always provide gas when calling a contract method or sending a transaction to have consistent behavior. If you don't provide gas, web3.js and ethers.js will estimate the gas for you. However, this doesn't always work as expected. 


MetaKeep web3 provider adds a default gas=21000 if gas is missing. However, this default gas is not sufficient for all transactions. For example, if you are calling a contract method that requires more gas, the transaction will fail.

### Provide gasPrice
Similar to gas, you should always provide gasPrice when calling a contract method or sending a transaction to have consistent behavior. If you don't provide gasPrice, web3.js and ethers.js will estimate the gasPrice for you. However, this doesn't always work as expected.


For lower user friction, we recommend using the [`/v3/getWallet`](ref:v3-getwallet-api) API endpoint instead of the SDK. The [`/v3/getWallet`](ref:v3-getwallet-api) API endpoint doesn't require user verification.

SDK will always require user verification unless you a provide a user when initializing the SDK. For example, if you are using the SDK in a server side environment, you can provide a user when initializing the SDK. This will allow you to use the SDK without user verification.

# PGSQL
Query to insert an element into a table with (id, name) columns with a transaction



```
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO user (id, name) VALUES (1, 'name1');
COMMIT;
```

find all row locks in the database

```
SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE locktype = 'relation';
```


Get queries waiting for a lock

```
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE
```

```
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE waiting = 't';
```



Thank you for your kind words. I am glad the issue has been resolved. 
As requested, here's the updated documentation https://docs.metakeep.xyz/reference/web3-provider#common-issues. 
Please let me know if you have any suggestions. We will be happy to add them to the documentation.


We are still working on the deck. Business and tech side is keeping us busy. We will share the deck with you as soon as it's ready.


Hey Parth. Thanks for the application. We have filled the position. We will keep you in mind for future openings.

Here's a table of all possible error status returned by the SDK


Apart from the above errors, the SDK can also return the errors mentioned in the different signing operations in the documentation:

FAQ:

Are there type definitions for the SDK?
Yes, the SDK has type definitions that you can use with TypeScript or JavaScript.
They are automatically included when you install the SDK using npm or yarn.
